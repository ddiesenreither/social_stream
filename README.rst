SOCIAL STREAM
=============================================================================


A TYPO3 extension to crawl the data, posts, events and images from a Social Media Page and saves them as tx_news records to the database.

The posts are saved as normal news articles from the tx_news extension.

Highly extendable with every Social Media Platform, that provides an API

Provides a scheduler task so the pages are crawled each day.

Configuration
=============================================================================


Please include the Plugin in you Main Template and then change to the Constant Editor.

Select PLUGIN.TX_SOCIALSTREAM_PI1

The plugin requires your storage PID, app ID and app secret.

You can get an app ID and app secret when you create a new facebook app at https://developers.facebook.com/.

Create a facebook app
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Firstly you need to register with your facebook account.

You are now registered as a facebook developer, that means you can now create facebook apps.

Add a new app via the "My Apps" button on the top right.

Choose a Website App and skip the quickstart (top right in the picture).

Now you have a facebook app and can copy the **App Id** and the **App Secret** into the Constants of the ``Social Stream`` Plugin.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Add a channel
=============================================================================


Go to the List View ov you storage Folder and create a new Social Stream Channel.

Select your Type, enter your Object ID and save.

After you saved, you have to get your Access Token - click on the button.

The PopUp redirects you to your Social Media Page - you have to log in and accept the plugin.

Get the name or id of your facebook page
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


For example:

If your facebook page URL is https://www.facebook.com/siwa.online/?fref=ts then your name is ``siwa.online``

You can look your page ID up on this site: https://findmyfbid.com/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Use the scheduler to crawl for posts once a day
=============================================================================


Menu **Scheduled tasks**

Create a new task with the class  ``extbase`` - ``Extbase CommandController Task`` and enter the rootPage ID if your Root Page hasn't the ID 1

Type ``Recurring``, Frequency ``0 0 * * *``

Menu **setup check**

The first rootpage must have an storagePid set in the constants, otherwise the CommandController can't find the entries!

Copy the script line ``<path-to-your-typo3>/typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3 scheduler:run``

Enter this line in your /etc/crontab file.

I would recommend 0/5 * * * * so your scheduler is called every 5 minutes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



NEWS
=============================================================================


You will now have many tx_news records in your storage folder also categorized.

The templating is now up to you.

You can use the standard news template or design your own one.
